# Tasks and Technical Decisions

This document tracks the implementation of each task, the technical decisions made, and how different components are integrated in the architecture.

## Story 1: Infrastructure Setup and Authentication

### Task 1.1: Project Initialization
- **Status**: In progress
- **Technical Decisions**: 
  - Using Express.js for the web framework due to its simplicity and extensive middleware ecosystem
  - Implementing a modular project structure to improve maintainability
  - Using dotenv for environment variable management
  - Adding morgan for HTTP request logging
  - Implementing centralized error handling
- **Integration Points**:
  - Express server as the foundation for all API endpoints
  - Environment configuration for managing different deployment environments
  - Health check endpoint for monitoring service availability

### Task 1.2: Redis Configuration
- **Status**: Completed
- **Technical Decisions**: 
  - Using ioredis library instead of the standard redis client for better Promise support and built-in reconnection
  - Implementing a singleton pattern for Redis connection management
  - Using key prefixes to create logical separation between different data types
  - Storing complex objects as JSON strings and contacts as Redis hashes
  - Implementing TTL for cached items to prevent stale data
  - Using exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- **Integration Points**:
  - Redis service as the central data store for both AcmeCRM and integration data
  - Separate namespaces for AcmeCRM data and integration service data
  - Caching layer for frequently accessed data
  - Connection error handling and automatic reconnection

### Task 1.3: Kafka Setup
- **Status**: In progress
- **Technical Decisions**: 
  - Using kafkajs library for its modern Promise-based API and active maintenance
  - Organizing topics by event type for targeted consumption
  - Implementing consumer groups for parallel processing and horizontal scaling
  - Using dead-letter topics for handling failed events
  - Implementing retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Using JSON for message payloads with metadata
- **Integration Points**:
  - Kafka service as the messaging backbone for asynchronous processing
  - Producer service for publishing events from webhook endpoints
  - Consumer framework for processing events based on type
  - Integration with Redis for storing processed data

### Task 1.4: JWT Authentication Implementation
- **Status**: Completed
- **Technical Decisions**: 
  - Using JWT for stateless authentication with configurable expiration
  - Implementing token refresh with sliding expiration strategy
  - Storing token metadata in Redis for validation and revocation
  - Using middleware pattern for protecting routes
  - Implementing proper error handling for authentication failures
  - Added role-based access control for authorization
- **Integration Points**:
  - Authentication service for token management
  - Redis for token storage and validation
  - Express middleware for protecting routes
  - User model for credential validation
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created auth.service.js for token generation, verification, refresh, and revocation
  - Implemented auth.middleware.js for route protection and role-based access
  - Added auth.controller.js with login, refresh, and logout endpoints
  - Set up auth.routes.js to define authentication API routes
  - Created auth.test.js to verify authentication functionality
  - Authentication routes for login, refresh, and logout

### Task 1.5: Error Handling and Rate Limiting
- **Status**: In progress
- **Technical Decisions**: 
  - Implementing centralized error handling middleware for consistent error responses
  - Using Redis for rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
  - Adding exponential backoff strategy for retries
  - Implementing request timeout handling
  - Enhancing logging for errors and rate limit events
- **Integration Points**:
  - Error middleware integrated with Express error handling
  - Rate limiter middleware applied to routes based on configuration
  - Redis used for storing rate limit counters
  - Logger enhanced for structured error reporting
