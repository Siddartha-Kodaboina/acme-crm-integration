# Asynchronous Processing Documentation

This document explains the asynchronous processing implementation for the AcmeCRM Integration Service. It will be updated as we implement the webhook handling and Kafka integration in Story 3.

## Webhook Architecture

### Overview

The webhook system allows AcmeCRM to notify our integration service about events (like contact creation, updates, or deletion) in real-time. Instead of processing these events synchronously, we use Kafka to handle them asynchronously for better reliability and scalability.

```
AcmeCRM (simulated) → Webhook → Integration Service → Kafka → Consumers → Processing
```

### Webhook Payload Format

Webhook payloads from AcmeCRM follow this format:

```json
{
  "event_type": "contact.created",
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-17T17:06:39-07:00",
  "data": {
    "contact_id": "1234",
    "acme_first_name": "John",
    "acme_last_name": "Doe",
    "acme_email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "acme_phone": "555-123-4567"
  }
}
```

## Kafka Implementation

### Configuration

Kafka is configured with the following settings:

```javascript
{
  clientId: 'acme-integration',
  brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
  retry: {
    initialRetryTime: 100,
    retries: 8
  }
}
```

### Topics

The following Kafka topics are used in the integration:

| Topic Name | Purpose | Retention |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `contact-events` | All contact-related events | 7 days |
| `contact-events-dlq` | Dead letter queue for failed events | 30 days |

### Producers

The Kafka producer service:

- Publishes events to the appropriate topics
- Handles serialization of event data to JSON
- Implements retry logic for failed publish attempts
- Adds metadata like timestamps and event IDs

### Consumers

Kafka consumers:

- Belong to consumer groups for parallel processing
- Process events based on event type
- Transform data between formats as needed
- Implement error handling with dead letter queues
- Support graceful shutdown
