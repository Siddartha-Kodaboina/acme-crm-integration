# Technical Decisions

This document outlines the key technical decisions made for the Lynq Integrations Engineer Take-Home Assessment.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework
- **Node.js with Express**: Chosen for its lightweight nature, extensive ecosystem, and suitability for building RESTful APIs.

### Data Storage
- **Redis**: Selected as the primary data store for both mock AcmeCRM data and integration service data. Redis provides:
  - Fast in-memory operations with optional persistence
  - Support for different data structures (strings, hashes, lists)
  - Built-in TTL (time-to-live) functionality for cache management
  - Atomic operations for data consistency
  - Simple setup and minimal configuration
  
  We're using Redis in two ways:
  - As a mock database for simulating AcmeCRM data storage
  - As a caching layer for frequently accessed data with configurable TTL

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Kafka**: Chosen for handling webhook events asynchronously. While more complex than alternatives like Redis queues, Kafka provides robust message streaming capabilities, scalability, and guaranteed message delivery. This demonstrates understanding of enterprise-grade event-driven architectures.

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Implementing JWT for authentication provides a stateless, secure method for verifying API requests. This matches the requirements for the mock AcmeCRM integration.

### Data Transformation
- **Field Mapping Service**: Created a dedicated service for transforming data between AcmeCRM format and our internal format. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable and adaptable to changes in either system's data structure.

### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes, consistent error formats, and detailed logging to facilitate debugging.
- **Rate Limiting with Backoff**: Added rate limiting to prevent API abuse and implemented exponential backoff for retries to handle temporary service disruptions gracefully.

### Caching Strategy
- **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Implemented the cache-aside pattern where the application first checks the cache for data, and if not found, retrieves it from the database and updates the cache.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Cache entries are invalidated when the corresponding data is updated or deleted to ensure data consistency.

## Tradeoffs

### SQLite vs. Full RDBMS
- **Tradeoff**: SQLite is simpler to set up but lacks some features of full database systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Justification**: For a take-home assessment, the simplicity of SQLite outweighs the benefits of a more powerful database system. In a production environment, we would likely use a more robust solution.

### Kafka vs. Simpler Queue Systems
- **Tradeoff**: Kafka adds complexity compared to simpler alternatives like Redis-based queues.
- **Justification**: The added complexity is justified by Kafka's robust features for event streaming, which align with the job requirements and demonstrate familiarity with enterprise-grade messaging systems.

### In-Memory Cache vs. Distributed Cache
- **Tradeoff**: A local Redis instance is simpler but doesn't scale as well as a distributed cache.
- **Justification**: For the scope of this assessment, a local Redis instance is sufficient. In a production environment with multiple service instances, we would configure Redis for distributed caching.

## Future Improvements

With more time, the following improvements could be made:

1. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Add more sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
3. Enhance documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
4. Implement monitoring and observability features
5. Add more robust security measures
6. Create a simple frontend for visualizing the integration
